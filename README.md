Version 0.0 - 

* Base Application.

--------------------------------

Version 0.1 - 

* Made rotating labels under the Circle tab always upright
* Added a hyperspace shader for the Circle Outline
* Added a loading bar that fluctuates from Red to Yellow to Green under the Log tab
* Implemented the cycle functionality for 15 & 20 minute cycles
* Fixed the time-saving system; it now accounts for cumulative odd time disparities
* Fixed PSA and Down Guard systems under the Pool tab to include all positions

--------------------------------

Version 0.2 - 

* Added a last log time label under the Log tab
* Added a radial shader on the Circle Main polygon with a Sine fluctuating black dot in the center for clarity that gradually shifts from Green to Yellow to Red as it sweeps around like a clock
* Made the hyperspace shader pull the same color as the radial shader and loading bar
* Added algorithmic support for multi-factor Guard cycling
* Added the logic for Guard staffing numbers 6 - 12
* Added a rotation lock slider under settings that can halt a rotation (ie, during stormy weather, other temporary closures)
* Implemented breaks into the logic for cycling rotations; it will now skip intervals on the default 16 and 18-hour marks
* Inserted a Guard Rotation Factor label and corresponding number under the Circle tab
* Removed the redundant Rotation Overview label from the Circle tab
* Added a lock that visually indicates a locked rotation on the Circle tab over the Circle Main, and also a - HOLD - over the loading bar
